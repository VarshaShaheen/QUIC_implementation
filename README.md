Project Overview

The rapid evolution of internet applications necessitates continuous improvements in data transmission technologies. The QUIC protocol, which offers significant advancements over traditional TCP/IP stack, including faster connection establishment, built-in encryption, and stream multiplexing without head-of-line blocking, is an important step in this direction.

However, QUIC's computational complexity and processing demands present challenges for software-based implementations, particularly under high-throughput conditions. This project proposes a novel approach to implementing the QUIC protocol on FPGAs, utilizing their inherent parallelism and reconfigurability to overcome these challenges and deliver high-performance network infrastructure for next-generation internet applications.
